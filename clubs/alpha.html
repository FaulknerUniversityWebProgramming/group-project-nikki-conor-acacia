    <div>
        <p> Alpha is the newest club on campus, being thought up in 2019 and official in the 2020 fall semester.
            Alpha's mascot is the wolf and along with their sister club they are a wolf pack. Since they
            are the new club, they have yet to estblish an identity for themselves.</p>
