Tasks
(things underlined are ideas/comments for the project in regard to how they will apply to it)

Home Page - The home page should be styled similarly to the chapter 7 homework, with a Navbar at the top, an aside on the left, and a footer at the bottom.  It should include some images.
A separate Contact form - It should include at least 4 different form control elements. (i.e. <input>, <label>, <select>, <textarea>, <button>, <fieldset>, <legend>, <datalist>, etc.)
While you are testing, have it send the results to a team member’s email.  Before you submit it, switch it so that the results of the form are sent to my email at shammond@faulkner.edu.
Login page – the login data should be stored in a table and the page should validate login data in your mySQL database.
Foreign exchange JSON API - (A donations page, or maybe a calculator for Club Fees [calculator will probably be more desirable, but could potentially do both]) - At least one of your pages should include a currency converter function.  Users should enter an amount, select the actual currency, select the desired currency and then the app should fetch the exchange rate from the Fixer API and display the converted rate.
One additional page of your choosing. (Feel free to add some ideas here as subtopics)
List of different clubs as interactive images or sections/hyperlinks - will be redirected to a page with Information on different guys/girls clubs
Information on different guys/girls clubs
